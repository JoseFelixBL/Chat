# Chat project
This project will comprise a chat server/client pair to connect over TCP/IP

The aim of the porject is to understand by practice the TCP/IP communication basics.

## Proposed steps
1. Make a client/ server that communicate.
2. Expand the former to make it muticlient, like a chat-room.
3. Expand it to a multi-rooms chat.

Other steps not in strict order:
4. Make it portable for other applications to import and use, i.e. batalla naval
5. Make sure it works on a local PC, on an intra-net and over internet.
6. Maybe practice threading.
7. Class use.
